## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 30de8fa: Build with the native TypeScript compiler and drop Rollup. Each module in `dist/` is emitted by `tsc` as written, then the type tests, the in-source tests, the identity casts and the comments are removed from it. The declarations are unchanged, every module exports the same names as before, and the JavaScript is smaller: 1437 KB across these packages before, 1041 KB after.

    Two things change in the published JavaScript. `export` declarations appear inline rather than in a trailing `export { ... }` list, and the line structure is the source's rather than a bundler's, so a stack trace or a source map lands where the code was written.

    `github-settings-as-code` was already compiled by `tsc`; what it gains here is the removal pass, so its `dist/` no longer carries `expectType(...)` calls.
