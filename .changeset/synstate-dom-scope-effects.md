'synstate-dom': minor
'blueprint-synstate': patch
---

synstate-dom exports `subscribeInScope`, `listenInScope` and `createAfterUpdate`, what a component, called once, does in place of an effect: a subscription or an event listener that lasts until the current scope is disposed, and work run in a microtask once the update under way has finished. blueprint-synstate uses them instead of its own copies, and needs a synstate-dom that exports them.
