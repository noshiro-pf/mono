Require `synstate` 9 as a peer (and, for synstate-dom and blueprint-synstate, `ts-data-forge` 15). Its `Optional` is unwrapped at runtime (a `Some` is the value it holds), and these packages read the snapshots of observables through `Optional.unwrap`, which would misread the `{ $$tag, value }` object an earlier synstate returns. The peer ranges move with this release (`changeset version` raises the `>=` peer range of a released dependent to the dependency's new version). In synstate-dom, avoid giving `MatchOptional` a constant `Optional.some(observable$)`: a `Some` is its value at runtime, so it is read as `observable$` itself.
