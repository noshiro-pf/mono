Mark issues as started or planned. `pr-report-core` adds the `in-progress` and `planned` labels (`IN_PROGRESS_LABEL`, `PLANNED_LABEL`) and `progressOf`: a startable issue labelled `in-progress` now reads as `in-progress`, as one an open pull request closes does, and one labelled `planned` as the new `planned` start state. `withProgress` takes that `IssueProgress` instead of a boolean. `pr-merge-queue` adds `start-issue`, which labels an issue `in-progress` before work on it begins and refuses one already labelled so or closed by an open pull request, unless given `--force`.
